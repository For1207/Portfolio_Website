              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <h2>You guessed it right! I want to give myself a fresh  start as a web developer and this website is my portfolio. 
                I have created it to demonstrate my knowledge and skills</h2>
              </div>
            <div class="projects">
              <p>
                I am an <span class="emphasize">ambitious front-end web developer</span> with a solid foundation that will allow me to progress quickly. My previous experience in business will contribute to project work and client relationships. <span class="emphasize">Diligence, high intelligence</span>, and <span class="emphasize">friendly attitude</span> toward people will make me a reliable member of my new team.
             </p>
             <p>
                I was a <span class="emphasize">successful executive</span> for many years and dealt with computer technology from a managerial point of view. I have always been distinguished by an impeccable <span class="emphasize">business reputation</span>, <span class="emphasize">independent thinking</span>, the ability to <span class="emphasize">analyze information</span> and <span class="emphasize">implement results</span> into business processes.
             </p>
             <p>
                My life changed drastically when my family moved to a new country. I took it not only as a challenge but also as an opportunity. Not afraid to start all over again, I got the chance to embody myself where I am strongest.
             </p>
             <p>
                <span class="emphasize">Why did I decide to become a web developer?</span> 
             </p>
             <p>
                Firstly, I like to see how a <span class="emphasize">problem</span> that initially seems to be a formless lump reveals logical relationships, then <span class="emphasize">becomes a system</span> and <span class="emphasize">transforms into code</span>, and finally is <span class="emphasize">born on the screen</span>. I always get aesthetic pleasure when I come across a good website.
             </p>
             <p>
                Secondly, having extensive experience in business, I clearly understand my strengths and weaknesses. My intuition tells me that the web developer profession is where I will be <span class="emphasize">valuable to the company</span> and <span class="emphasize">thriving</span> as a <span class="emphasize">professional</span> for many years.
             </p>
             <p>
                And now, I am proud to share my first achievement in a new profession - graduating from Wilmington University and receiving a <span class="emphasize">bachelor's degree</span> in <span class="emphasize">computer science</span> with Summa Cum Laude title. In addition, I am gaining additional practice by studying the "Front-End Engineer" course at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.
             </p>
             <p>
                It means that an exciting journey is waiting for me, and my motivation and hard work give me confidence that <span class="em">I will achieve my goals</span>.
             </p>
